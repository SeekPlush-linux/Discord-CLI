# Discord-CLI
Discord CLI is a Discord command-line client made purely in Python.

It has the most necessary features for a usable Discord client, like:
- Sending, replying, editing and deleting messages
- Switching betweeen channels and servers
- changing your status indicator
- ...and more!

## Installation
**To start using Discord CLI, you'll need to follow the instructions first.**

### Requirements:
  1. Python should be installed on your device
  2. Your Discord token
  3. Your Discord username

But first, make sure to clone this repo, preferrably with the command `git clone` in the terminal.

Now, if you don't know already how to get your Discord token, go to this link [here](https://gist.github.com/MarvNC/e601f3603df22f36ebd3102c501116c6).
Once you have your Discord token, paste it into the file `token.txt` (don't forget to remove the placeholder in the file).
And put your Discord username into the file `username.txt` (again, remove the placeholder in the file first).

The last step is to install the required Python libraries by typing this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you should be good to go! Just open `discord-cli.py` and you should be able to use it without any problems.

But if you have any questions, bug reports, or really anything, make sure to DM me on Discord [here](https://discord.com/users/728655009759363191).

Anyways, have fun using Discord CLI!
